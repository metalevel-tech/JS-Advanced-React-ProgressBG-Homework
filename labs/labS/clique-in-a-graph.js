/*
    A clique in a graph is set of nodes such that there is an edge between any two 
    distinct nodes in the set. Finding the largest clique in a graph is a computationally 
    difficult problem. Currently no polynomial time algorithm is known for solving this. 
    However, you wonder what is the minimum size of the largest clique in any graph 
    with 'n' nodes and 'm' edges.

    For example, consider a graph with n=4 nodes and m=5 edges.
    The graph below shows 4 nodes with 4 edges and no cliques.
    It is evident that the addition of any 5th edge must create 'two' cliques with '3' members each.
