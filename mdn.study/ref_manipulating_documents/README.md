## Manipulating documents, references

* [MDN: Manipulating documents](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents)


## Basic objects

* [MDN: `document` object](): The document (represented by the DOM in browsers) is the actual page loaded into the `window`, and is represented in JavaScript by the `Document` object. You can use this object to return and manipulate information on the HTML and CSS that comprises the document, for example get a reference to an element in the DOM, change its text content, apply new styles to it, create new elements and add them to the current element as children, or even delete it altogether.
 
* [MDN: `window` object](): The `window` is the browser tab that a web page is loaded into; this is represented in JavaScript by the `Window` object. Using methods available on this object you can do things like return the `window`'s size (see `Window.innerWidth` and `Window.innerHeight`), manipulate the document loaded into that `window`, store data specific to that document on the client-side (for example using a local database or other storage mechanism), attach an `event handler` to the current `window`, and more.
 
* [MDN: `navigator` object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator): The navigator represents the state and identity of the browser (i.e. the user-agent) as it exists on the web. In JavaScript, this is represented by the `Navigator` object. You can use this object to retrieve things like the user's preferred language, a media stream from the user's webcam, etc.
