## Condition of the task

> In this assessment you'll be tasked with taking some of the knowledge you've picked up in this module's articles and applying it to creating a fun app that generates random silly stories. Have fun!.


## Solutions

* The file [silly_story_generator.main.v.1.init.js](silly_story_generator.main.v.1.init.js) is created by following the steps provided at the *Silly story generator* assessment (exercise).

* The file [silly_story_generator.main.v.2.reusable-template-literals.js](silly_story_generator.main.v.2.reusable-template-literals.js) is a little bit improved version that uses reusable template literals function with arrow syntax.

    ```js
    const storyTextFn = (x, y, z) => `It was 94 fahrenheit outside, so ${x} went for a walk. When they got to ${y}, they stared in horror for a few moments, then ${z}. Bob saw the whole thing, but was not surprised â€” ${x} weighs 300 pounds, and it was a hot day.`;
    // ...
    let newStory = storyTextFn(xItem, yItem, zItem);
    ```
